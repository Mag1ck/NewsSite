# NewsSite

Overwiew

This project is a site that looks similar to tiktok. We can add news using api 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api' but first u have to be logged in u can use 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin' (have to create super user before) if You create account you can login using this link: 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/login'. Site can be scrolled using key up and key down or mouse wheel. I've also implemented infinity scroll to improve web site experience. Posts are sorted by date meaning the newest post will be shown as first.
